Welcome to Cardre! The all inclusive scorecard building tool for Linux!

I'm building this to learn software dev. Is it the best in class solution? No! Is it the best I can do? Yes!
Maybe it will be open source and then all these people selling their products can have a hard time selling them in future.

I'm gonna say it's AI powered because it has regression in it and that seems to suffice these days.
